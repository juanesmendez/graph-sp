# Random Graph üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

## Description

Simple program in Matlab that generates a random graph, consisting of 100 nodes. The graph is plotted, as well as the shortest path between two random nodes. In addition, the distance between every pair of nodes is calculated using the ecleudian distance equation. If the distance between a pair of nodes is less than 14, then a path is drawn connecting the two nodes. The nodes have ID's from 1 to 100, and the coordinates that are randomly generated are in the following range: [0, 100]. Dijkstra's algorithm was used to calculate the shortest path between two random nodes. The path is drawn in red.

## How to run the project?

- Install Matlab
- Open the project
- Execute the `taller_1.m` file.
- For for the project being able to run correctly, the `dijkstra_v2.m` file has to be in the same directory as the `taller_1.m` file.
